# Lab 4: Map Design and Tile Generation

## Description

I examined the Seattle Area, where the dataset for bike locations owned and maintained by the SDOT (Seattle Department of Transportation) were centralized. I started off the map zoom at 11, because it captures the dataset well. While you are able to zoom out to around Zoom level 5 for each tile set, it looks the best with the street data and datapoints further apart.
